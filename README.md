# Node.js-MySQL
In this repository you are going to see some pictures (file "SS") of how my bamazonCustomer.js is working.

#### Bamazon is an app that simulates a shopping window of a store over a command line interface (CLI).

This activity is about creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory

#### Feel free to check out the code and how it looks on git bash in the screen shots folder.

### Also make sure to check out my portafolio, where I have more projects.
